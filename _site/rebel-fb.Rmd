**Machine Learning Models Regression Models**

**Linear Regression**: For predicting sales or demand based on various factors.

**Gradient Boosting Models** (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): For accurate demand forecasting and price prediction. Classification Models

**Logistic Regression**: For customer segmentation or churn prediction. Random Forest: For classifying customer types or predicting operational metrics.

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For classifying different customer segments. Clustering Models

**K-Means Clustering**: To segment customers based on purchasing behavior. DBSCAN: For identifying clusters of restaurants or delivery zones. Time Series Models

**ARIMA**: For forecasting sales and customer demand over time. Prophet: For capturing seasonality in sales data. Deep Learning Models Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)**: For predicting demand trends based on historical data.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:For analyzing images of dishes or restaurant environments, potentially for visual recognition tasks. Transformer Models

**Transformers**: For tasks involving sequential data and context understanding, such as sales forecasting based on temporal features.

**Large Language Models (LLMs) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** For sentiment analysis of customer reviews and feedback.

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: GPT-3/4: For generating marketing content, handling customer inquiries, and summarizing customer feedback.

**DistilBERT:** A lightweight version of BERT for efficient sentiment analysis and text classification tasks.

**T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):** For versatile NLP tasks such as summarizing reviews and generating reports.
